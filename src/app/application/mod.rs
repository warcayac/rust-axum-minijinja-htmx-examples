/*
2. Application Layer (Use Cases)
---------------------------------
- Purpose: Serving as an intermediary between the Domain Layer and external systems, the Application Layer 
    defines workflows and coordinates the Domain Layer components to fulfill specific use cases.
- Contents: This layer includes application services, use cases, and data transfer objects (DTOs) that organize 
    the flow of data and interactions within various scenarios.
- Role with Domain Layer: The Application Layer interacts with domain entities and services but does not alter 
    core business logic. If any business rules or logic need modification, those changes occur in the Domain 
    Layer, not here.
